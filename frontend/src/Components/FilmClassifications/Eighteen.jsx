          <strong> Exceptions are most likely in the following areas:</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          <li>
            {" "}
            where the material is in breach of the criminal law, or has been
            created through the commission of a criminal offence
          </li>
          <li>
            {" "}
            where material or treatment appears to us to risk harm to
            individuals or, through their behaviour, to society. For example,
            the detailed portrayal of violent or dangerous acts, or of illegal
            drug use, which may cause harm to public health or morals. This may
            include portrayals of sadistic violence, rape or other
            non-consensual sexually violent behaviour which make this violence
            look appealing; reinforce the suggestion that victims enjoy rape or
            other non-consensual sexually violent behaviour; or which invite
            viewer complicity in rape, other non-consensual sexually violent
            behaviour or other harmful violent activities
          </li>
          <li>
            where there are more explicit images of sexual activity in the
            context of a sex work (see right) In the case of video works, which
            may be more accessible to younger viewers, intervention may be more
            frequent than for cinema films.
          </li>
