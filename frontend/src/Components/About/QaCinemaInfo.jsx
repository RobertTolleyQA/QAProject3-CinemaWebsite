            <h1> About Us</h1>
            <hr></hr>
            <p>QA Cinemas is an independent cinema, founded by Team Spell as part of our final project for the QA training course. </p>
            <p>Our mission is to bring customer satisfaction via a unique collection of carefully picked, highly rated films, a comfortable and enjoyable viewing experience, and an informative easy-to-use website.</p>
            <p>To maximise accessibility and ensure all customers have the best possible experience, we have developed and implemented this website - detailing every aspect we deem to be a relevant part of the cinema experience (from film classification regulations, to cast and director information, to places to go before/after you visit the cinema). </p>
            <p>To explore this website and all that it has to offer, use the navigation bar, shown at the top of every page. To search for something specific, use our search function. To learn more about us as a team, scroll further down this page.</p>
